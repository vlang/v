## V 0.4
*1 July 2023*

This release has a combined changelog from 0.3.1 to 0.3.5.

You can read it here:

https://github.com/vlang/v/blob/master/changelogs0.x/0.4.md

## V 0.3.5
*29 June 2023*

#### Improvements in the language
- **Coroutines with a scheduler**. Only Linux/macOS for now, requires `-use-coroutines` and
  `coroutines.sleep()` instead of `time.sleep()`. They work with IO and net, but not with GC
  for now.
- `spawn` now spawns system threads, `go` spawns coroutines.
- Static type methods: `Foo.new()` to replace factory functions like `new_foo()`.
- Smartcasting with complex conditions:`if sum_type is Foo && !sum_type.is_info && get_name(sum_type.info.name) == 'foo' `.
- Functions can now return fixed size arrays.
- Enum values now can have attributes.
- Generic functions as function parameters are now supported: `fn f[T](x T, i int, f_ Fn[T]) T { `.
- Anonymous structs can no longer have attributes.

#### Breaking changes
- `byte` deprecated in favor of `u8` (`byte` is automatically converted to `u8` by vfmt).

#### Checker improvements/fixes
- Disallow `Result` type aliases (`type Foo = !Bar`) and `Result` in maps (`map[key]!Type`).
- Add a missing check for taking address of literal value member.
- Fixed map initialization for maps with option values.
- Allow `a << none`, where `a` is `[]?&int`.
- Disallow multiple `else` branches in a match.
- Fix index expression with sumtype of array types.

#### Standard library
- json: Enum value string serialization supports `[json:'alias']` to change its string values.
- Struct fields can now be skipped during JSON/ORM serialization via `[json:'-']` and `[sql:'-']`,
  in addition to `[skip]`. This allows having custom behavior for different serialization methods.

- stbi: add a `resize_uint8` function for resizing images in memory.
- time, x.json2: improve iso8601 time decoding.
- builtin: zero out internal map/array pointers on m.free(), to reduce the work for the GC
  mark phase for non escaping maps/arrays, used in hot loops.
- time: add more detailed error descriptions, add custom format parsing with time.parse_format.
- sync: add Mutex.destroy and RwMutex.destroy methods.
- datatypes: add Bloom filter.
- rand: add missing rand.u16(), update doc comments, add test.
- builtin: speed up string methods with vmemcpy instead of `for` loop for copying data.

- Fix comptimeselector option propagation.
- A mutability check for comptime assignments.
- Fix comptime assigning to sumtype or indexexpr.
- Make comptime calls work with or-block.

## V 0.3.4

*30 Apr 2023*

#### Breaking Changes

The following changes may break compilation of existing code or change behavior at runtime:

- `json`: enums are serialized as strings by default, `[json_as_number]` attribute can be used for
  the old behavior.

  If you are serializing enums to JSON in your application, then you will need to add the
  `[json_as_number]` attribute to keep the old behavior!

- Variable shadowing has been completely banned (previously variable names could conflict with
  module names).

#### Web

- vweb now supports live page reloading.
  The web app is instantly updated in the browser (no need to refresh the page)
  every time a **.v** or a **.html** file is changed.
- vweb is now significantly faster and more stable under load, due to a new multithreaded worker
  pool, which is much more efficient at spreading the workload among all threads equally.
- vweb now supports middleware.
- vweb now supports controllers.
  It's now possible to have multiple app structs to better separate logic.
- vweb now supports overridable `.not_found()` method for custom 404 pages in vweb.
- vweb now uses database pool.
- Fixed multipart form parsing in vweb.

#### Backends

- A new pure WASM backend, based on binaryen, a WASM `builtin` module, and a pure V WASM serialization library.
- Lots of fixes and new features in the native backend, including making codegen logic platform independent.
- Now code generated by the С backend, can be compiled by a C++20 compiler.
- C backend does not generate unused interface functions now.

#### Compiler CLI

- `v share file.v` for sharing code via the playground.
- `v up` speed up for when it hasn't been run for a long time (**vc/** bootstrapping has been
  optimized).
- `v init` no longer overwrites existing `src/main.v`.
- `v self` now uses a faster TCC backend on macOS (Intel/Apple Silicon), just like on Windows/Linux.
- A new command line flag `-e` for running short V programs on command line: `v -e "println(2+5)"` (
  works just like in Perl).
- A new `-ldflags` option, in addition to `-cflags`. Works just like LDFLAGS in C.

#### ORM

- All ORM queries now return `![]` (`Result` of an array).
  This allows handling/propagating DB errors and simplifies working with ORM (one way).
- Many ORM improvements: type checks for `limit/offset/order by/where`; support of reference objects
  in `insert`; struct fields can be used with `limit/offset`; `Connection` interface.
- ORM now supports the `like` operator:
  ```v
  users := sql db {
      select from User where name like 'Bob%'
  }
  ```
- A new `-d trace_orm` option to see all SQL queries generated and used by V ORM and
  `-d trace_pg_error` to trace PG errors.

#### Standard Library

- Added new `termios` module.
- `net.ssl`: types using ssl contexts can now be converted to strings via `.str()`/printed
  via `println()`.
- `v.reflection`: added type symbol info metadata.
- `crypto` and `math` modules have been updated to use `Result` instead of `Option`.
- `datatypes.LinkedList[map]` now works correctly.
- `urllib.Values.get()` now returns an Option.
- `strconv`: `v_printf()` was made private, `v_sprintf()` was deprecated. String interpolation
  should be used instead.
- `net.http`: mime types have been updated to include all official types.
- `gg`: `create_image()` now returns `!Image` instead of `Image`, allowing to handle errors.
- `sokol`: errors during image creation no longer result in a panic, but can be handled by the
  programmer.
- `sokol`: macOS apps can now be quit using **Cmd+Q**.
- `os.hostname()` and `os.loginname()` now return `Result`.
- `strconv.atoi` optimizations.
- `println()` now supports arrays with recursive references.
- `termux`: support for cross-compilation from termux to other platforms.
- `readline` module now works much better on macOS: key navigation, history, etc (now on par with
  Linux).
- `os`: fixed a memleak in `getline()`.
- `os.Process` now has a `create_no_window` option (Windows only).
- `os.Process` now has a `set_work_folder()` method to set the initial working folder of the new
  child process.

#### Option as a first class type

Final steps in making the Option type a first class type:

- If guards now work with struct fields which are `Option` functions.
  Such fields can now also be assigned to other fields/variables.
- Option receivers can no longer have methods.
- `none` can now be cast to all `Option` types, including aliases.
- Option references are now supported: `?&Type`.
- Arrays of `Option`s are now allowed.
- Allow `foo := Foo{}`, when `Foo` has an Option field, that is a struct, that has a `[required]`
  tag on its fields.

#### Compile-time Reflection

- Compile-time interface fields evaluation.
- Compile-time enum evaluation:
  ```v
  $for item in MyEnum.fields {
