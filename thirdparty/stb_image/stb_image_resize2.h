/* stb_image_resize2 - v2.06 - public domain image resizing

   by Jeff Roberts (v2) and Jorge L Rodriguez
   http://github.com/nothings/stb

   Can be threaded with the extended API. SSE2, AVX, Neon and WASM SIMD support. Only
   scaling and translation is supported, no rotations or shears.

   COMPILING & LINKING
      In one C/C++ file that #includes this file, do this:
         #define STB_IMAGE_RESIZE_IMPLEMENTATION
      before the #include. That will create the implementation in that file.

   PORTING FROM VERSION 1

      The API has changed. You can continue to use the old version of stb_image_resize.h,
      which is available in the "deprecated/" directory.

      If you're using the old simple-to-use API, porting is straightforward.
      (For more advanced APIs, read the documentation.)

        stbir_resize_uint8():
          - call `stbir_resize_uint8_linear`, cast channel count to `stbir_pixel_layout`

        stbir_resize_float():
          - call `stbir_resize_float_linear`, cast channel count to `stbir_pixel_layout`

        stbir_resize_uint8_srgb():
          - function name is unchanged
          - cast channel count to `stbir_pixel_layout`
          - above is sufficient unless your image has alpha and it's not RGBA/BGRA
            - in that case, follow the below instructions for stbir_resize_uint8_srgb_edgemode

        stbir_resize_uint8_srgb_edgemode()
          - switch to the "medium complexity" API
          - stbir_resize(), very similar API but a few more parameters:
            - pixel_layout: cast channel count to `stbir_pixel_layout`
            - data_type:    STBIR_TYPE_UINT8_SRGB
            - edge:         unchanged (STBIR_EDGE_WRAP, etc.)
            - filter:       STBIR_FILTER_DEFAULT
          - which channel is alpha is specified in stbir_pixel_layout, see enum for details

   EASY API CALLS:
     Easy API downsamples w/Mitchell filter, upsamples w/cubic interpolation, clamps to edge.

     stbir_resize_uint8_srgb( input_pixels,  input_w,  input_h,  input_stride_in_bytes,
                              output_pixels, output_w, output_h, output_stride_in_bytes,
                              pixel_layout_enum )

     stbir_resize_uint8_linear( input_pixels,  input_w,  input_h,  input_stride_in_bytes,
                                output_pixels, output_w, output_h, output_stride_in_bytes,
                                pixel_layout_enum )

     stbir_resize_float_linear( input_pixels,  input_w,  input_h,  input_stride_in_bytes,
                                output_pixels, output_w, output_h, output_stride_in_bytes,
                                pixel_layout_enum )

     If you pass NULL or zero for the output_pixels, we will allocate the output buffer
     for you and return it from the function (free with free() or STBIR_FREE).
     As a special case, XX_stride_in_bytes of 0 means packed continuously in memory.

   API LEVELS
      There are three levels of API - easy-to-use, medium-complexity and extended-complexity.

      See the "header file" section of the source for API documentation.

   ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTATION

      MEMORY ALLOCATION
         By default, we use malloc and free for memory allocation.  To override the
         memory allocation, before the implementation #include, add a:

            #define STBIR_MALLOC(size,user_data) ...
            #define STBIR_FREE(ptr,user_data)   ...

         Each resize makes exactly one call to malloc/free (unless you use the
         extended API where you can do one allocation for many resizes). Under
         address sanitizer, we do separate allocations to find overread/writes.

      PERFORMANCE
         This library was written with an emphasis on performance. When testing
         stb_image_resize with RGBA, the fastest mode is STBIR_4CHANNEL with
         STBIR_TYPE_UINT8 pixels and CLAMPed edges (which is what many other resize
         libs do by default). Also, make sure SIMD is turned on of course (default
         for 64-bit targets). Avoid WRAP edge mode if you want the fastest speed.

         This library also comes with profiling built-in. If you define STBIR_PROFILE,
         you can use the advanced API and get low-level profiling information by
         calling stbir_resize_extended_profile_info() or stbir_resize_split_profile_info()
         after a resize.

      SIMD
         Most of the routines have optimized SSE2, AVX, NEON and WASM versions.

         On Microsoft compilers, we automatically turn on SIMD for 64-bit x64 and
         ARM; for 32-bit x86 and ARM, you select SIMD mode by defining STBIR_SSE2 or
         STBIR_NEON. For AVX and AVX2, we auto-select it by detecting the /arch:AVX
         or /arch:AVX2 switches. You can also always manually turn SSE2, AVX or AVX2
         support on by defining STBIR_SSE2, STBIR_AVX or STBIR_AVX2.

         On Linux, SSE2 and Neon is on by default for 64-bit x64 or ARM64. For 32-bit,
         we select x86 SIMD mode by whether you have -msse2, -mavx or -mavx2 enabled
         on the command line. For 32-bit ARM, you must pass -mfpu=neon-vfpv4 for both
         clang and GCC, but GCC also requires an additional -mfp16-format=ieee to
         automatically enable NEON.

         On x86 platforms, you can also define STBIR_FP16C to turn on FP16C instructions
         for converting back and forth to half-floats. This is autoselected when we
         are using AVX2. Clang and GCC also require the -mf16c switch. ARM always uses
         the built-in half float hardware NEON instructions.

         You can also tell us to use multiply-add instructions with STBIR_USE_FMA.
         Because x86 doesn't always have fma, we turn it off by default to maintain
         determinism across all platforms. If you don't care about non-FMA determinism
         and are willing to restrict yourself to more recent x86 CPUs (around the AVX
         timeframe), then fma will give you around a 15% speedup.

         You can force off SIMD in all cases by defining STBIR_NO_SIMD. You can turn
         off AVX or AVX2 specifically with STBIR_NO_AVX or STBIR_NO_AVX2. AVX is 10%
         to 40% faster, and AVX2 is generally another 12%.

      ALPHA CHANNEL
         Most of the resizing functions provide the ability to control how the alpha
         channel of an image is processed.

         When alpha represents transparency, it is important that when combining
         colors with filtering, the pixels should not be treated equally; they
         should use a weighted average based on their alpha values. For example,
         if a pixel is 1% opaque bright green and another pixel is 99% opaque
         black and you average them, the average will be 50% opaque, but the
         unweighted average and will be a middling green color, while the weighted
         average will be nearly black. This means the unweighted version introduced
         green energy that didn't exist in the source image.

         (If you want to know why this makes sense, you can work out the math for
         the following: consider what happens if you alpha composite a source image
         over a fixed color and then average the output, vs. if you average the
         source image pixels and then composite that over the same fixed color.
         Only the weighted average produces the same result as the ground truth
         composite-then-average result.)

         Therefore, it is in general best to "alpha weight" the pixels when applying
         filters to them. This essentially means multiplying the colors by the alpha
         values before combining them, and then dividing by the alpha value at the
         end.

         The computer graphics industry introduced a technique called "premultiplied
         alpha" or "associated alpha" in which image colors are stored in image files
         already multiplied by their alpha. This saves some math when compositing,
         and also avoids the need to divide by the alpha at the end (which is quite
         inefficient). However, while premultiplied alpha is common in the movie CGI
         industry, it is not commonplace in other industries like videogames, and most
         consumer file formats are generally expected to contain not-premultiplied
         colors. For example, Photoshop saves PNG files "unpremultiplied", and web
         browsers like Chrome and Firefox expect PNG images to be unpremultiplied.

         Note that there are three possibilities that might describe your image
         and resize expectation:

             1. images are not premultiplied, alpha weighting is desired
             2. images are not premultiplied, alpha weighting is not desired
             3. images are premultiplied

         Both case #2 and case #3 require the exact same math: no alpha weighting
         should be applied or removed. Only case 1 requires extra math operations;
         the other two cases can be handled identically.

         stb_image_resize expects case #1 by default, applying alpha weighting to
         images, expecting the input images to be unpremultiplied. This is what the
         COLOR+ALPHA buffer types tell the resizer to do.

         When you use the pixel layouts STBIR_RGBA, STBIR_BGRA, STBIR_ARGB,
         STBIR_ABGR, STBIR_RX, or STBIR_XR you are telling us that the pixels are
         non-premultiplied. In these cases, the resizer will alpha weight the colors
         (effectively creating the premultiplied image), do the filtering, and then
         convert back to non-premult on exit.

         When you use the pixel layouts STBIR_RGBA_PM, STBIR_RGBA_PM, STBIR_RGBA_PM,
         STBIR_RGBA_PM, STBIR_RX_PM or STBIR_XR_PM, you are telling that the pixels
         ARE premultiplied. In this case, the resizer doesn't have to do the
         premultipling - it can filter directly on the input. This about twice as
         fast as the non-premultiplied case, so it's the right option if your data is
         already setup correctly.

         When you use the pixel layout STBIR_4CHANNEL or STBIR_2CHANNEL, you are
         telling us that there is no channel that represents transparency; it may be
         RGB and some unrelated fourth channel that has been stored in the alpha
         channel, but it is actually not alpha. No special processing will be
         performed.

         The difference between the generic 4 or 2 channel layouts, and the
         specialized _PM versions is with the _PM versions you are telling us that
         the data *is* alpha, just don't premultiply it. That's important when
         using SRGB pixel formats, we need to know where the alpha is, because
         it is converted linearly (rather than with the SRGB converters).

         Because alpha weighting produces the same effect as premultiplying, you
         even have the option with non-premultiplied inputs to let the resizer
         produce a premultiplied output. Because the intially computed alpha-weighted
         output image is effectively premultiplied, this is actually more performant
         than the normal path which un-premultiplies the output image as a final step.

         Finally, when converting both in and out of non-premulitplied space (for
         example, when using STBIR_RGBA), we go to somewhat heroic measures to
         ensure that areas with zero alpha value pixels get something reasonable
         in the RGB values. If you don't care about the RGB values of zero alpha
         pixels, you can call the stbir_set_non_pm_alpha_speed_over_quality()
         function - this runs a premultiplied resize about 25% faster. That said,
         when you really care about speed, using premultiplied pixels for both in
         and out (STBIR_RGBA_PM, etc) much faster than both of these premultiplied
         options.

      PIXEL LAYOUT CONVERSION
         The resizer can convert from some pixel layouts to others. When using the
         stbir_set_pixel_layouts(), you can, for example, specify STBIR_RGBA
         on input, and STBIR_ARGB on output, and it will re-organize the channels
         during the resize. Currently, you can only convert between two pixel
         layouts with the same number of channels.

      DETERMINISM
         We commit to being deterministic (from x64 to ARM to scalar to SIMD, etc).
         This requires compiling with fast-math off (using at least /fp:precise).
         Also, you must turn off fp-contracting (which turns mult+adds into fmas)!
         We attempt to do this with pragmas, but with Clang, you usually want to add
         -ffp-contract=off to the command line as well.

         For 32-bit x86, you must use SSE and SSE2 codegen for determinism. That is,
         if the scalar x87 unit gets used at all, we immediately lose determinism.
         On Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 and earlier, from what we can tell there is
         no way to be deterministic in 32-bit x86 (some x87 always leaks in, even
         with fp:strict). On 32-bit x86 GCC, determinism requires both -msse2 and
         -fpmath=sse.

         Note that we will not be deterministic with float data containing NaNs -
         the NaNs will propagate differently on different SIMD and platforms.

         If you turn on STBIR_USE_FMA, then we will be deterministic with other
         fma targets, but we will differ from non-fma targets (this is unavoidable,
         because a fma isn't simply an add with a mult - it also introduces a
         rounding difference compared to non-fma instruction sequences.

      FLOAT PIXEL FORMAT RANGE
         Any range of values can be used for the non-alpha float data that you pass
         in (0 to 1, -1 to 1, whatever). However, if you are inputting float values
         but *outputting* bytes or shorts, you must use a range of 0 to 1 so that we
         scale back properly. The alpha channel must also be 0 to 1 for any format
         that does premultiplication prior to resizing.

         Note also that with float output, using filters with negative lobes, the
         output filtered values might go slightly out of range. You can define
         STBIR_FLOAT_LOW_CLAMP and/or STBIR_FLOAT_HIGH_CLAMP to specify the range
         to clamp to on output, if that's important.

      MAX/MIN SCALE FACTORS
         The input pixel resolutions are in integers, and we do the internal pointer
         resolution in size_t sized integers. However, the scale ratio from input
         resolution to output resolution is calculated in float form. This means
         the effective possible scale ratio is limited to 24 bits (or 16 million
         to 1). As you get close to the size of the float resolution (again, 16
         million pixels wide or high), you might start seeing float inaccuracy
         issues in general in the pipeline. If you have to do extreme resizes,
         you can usually do this is multiple stages (using float intermediate
         buffers).

      FLIPPED IMAGES
         Stride is just the delta from one scanline to the next. This means you can
         use a negative stride to handle inverted images (point to the final
         scanline and use a negative stride). You can invert the input or output,
         using negative strides.

      DEFAULT FILTERS
         For functions which don't provide explicit control over what filters to
         use, you can change the compile-time defaults with:

            #define STBIR_DEFAULT_FILTER_UPSAMPLE     STBIR_FILTER_something
            #define STBIR_DEFAULT_FILTER_DOWNSAMPLE   STBIR_FILTER_something

         See stbir_filter in the header-file section for the list of filters.

      NEW FILTERS
         A number of 1D filter kernels are supplied. For a list of supported
         filters, see the stbir_filter enum. You can install your own filters by
         using the stbir_set_filter_callbacks function.

      PROGRESS
         For interactive use with slow resize operations, you can use the the
         scanline callbacks in the extended API. It would have to be a *very* large
         image resample to need progress though - we're very fast.

      CEIL and FLOOR
         In scalar mode, the only functions we use from math.h are ceilf and floorf,
         but if you have your own versions, you can define the STBIR_CEILF(v) and
         STBIR_FLOORF(v) macros and we'll use them instead. In SIMD, we just use
         our own versions.

      ASSERT
         Define STBIR_ASSERT(boolval) to override assert() and not use assert.h

      FUTURE TODOS
        *  For polyphase integral filters, we just memcpy the coeffs to dupe
           them, but we should indirect and use the same coeff memory.
        *  Add pixel layout conversions for sensible different channel counts
           (maybe, 1->3/4, 3->4, 4->1, 3->1).
         * For SIMD encode and decode scanline routines, do any pre-aligning
           for bad input/output buffer alignments and pitch?
         * For very wide scanlines, we should we do vertical strips to stay within
           L2 cache. Maybe do chunks of 1K pixels at a time. There would be
           some pixel reconversion, but probably dwarfed by things falling out
           of cache. Probably also something possible with alternating between
           scattering and gathering at high resize scales?
         * Rewrite the coefficient generator to do many at once.
         * AVX-512 vertical kernels - worried about downclocking here.
         * Convert the reincludes to macros when we know they aren't changing.
         * Experiment with pivoting the horizontal and always using the
           vertical filters (which are faster, but perhaps not enough to overcome
           the pivot cost and the extra memory touches). Need to buffer the whole
           image so have to balance memory use.
         * Most of our code is internally function pointers, should we compile
           all the SIMD stuff always and dynamically dispatch?

// This will build samplers for threading.
//   You can pass in the number of threads you'd like to use (try_splits).

// Note that you MUST call stbir_build_samplers_with_splits before stbir_resize_extended_split!

// Usually, you will always call stbir_resize_split with split_start as the thread_index
//   and "1" for the split_count.
// But, if you have a weird situation where you MIGHT want 8 threads, but sometimes
//   only 4 threads, you can use 0,2,4,6 for the split_start's and use "2" for the
//   split_count each time to turn in into a 4 thread resize. (This is unusual).

//===============================================================


//===============================================================
// Pixel Callbacks info:
//--------------------------------

//   The input callback is super flexible - it calls you with the input address
//   (based on the stride and base pointer), it gives you an optional_output
//   pointer that you can fill, or you can just return your own pointer into
//   your own data.
//
//   You can also do conversion from non-supported data types if necessary - in
//   this case, you ignore the input_ptr and just use the x and y parameters to
//   calculate your own input_ptr based on the size of each non-supported pixel.
//   (Something like the third example below.)
//
//   You can also install just an input or just an output callback by setting the
//   callback that you don't want to zero.
//
//     First example, progress: (getting a callback that you can monitor the progress):
//        void const * my_callback( void * optional_output, void const * input_ptr, int num_pixels, int x, int y, void * context )
//        {
//           percentage_done = y / input_height;
//           return input_ptr;  // use buffer from call
//        }
//
//     Next example, copying: (copy from some other buffer or stream):
//        void const * my_callback( void * optional_output, void const * input_ptr, int num_pixels, int x, int y, void * context )
//        {
//           CopyOrStreamData( optional_output, other_data_src, num_pixels * pixel_width_in_bytes );
//           return optional_output;  // return the optional buffer that we filled
//        }
//
//     Third example, input another buffer without copying: (zero-copy from other buffer):
//        void const * my_callback( void * optional_output, void const * input_ptr, int num_pixels, int x, int y, void * context )
//        {
//           void * pixels = ( (char*) other_image_base ) + ( y * other_image_stride ) + ( x * other_pixel_width_in_bytes );
//           return pixels;       // return pointer to your data without copying
//        }
//
//
//   The output callback is considerably simpler - it just calls you so that you can dump
//   out each scanline. You could even directly copy out to disk if you have a simple format
//   like TGA or BMP. You can also convert to other output types here if you want.
//
//   Simple example:
//        void const * my_output( void * output_ptr, int num_pixels, int y, void * context )
//        {
//           percentage_done = y / output_height;
//           fwrite( output_ptr, pixel_width_in_bytes, num_pixels, output_file );
//        }

// Figure out whether to scale along the horizontal or vertical first.
//   This only *super* important when you are scaling by a massively
//   different amount in the vertical vs the horizontal (for example, if
//   you are scaling by 2x in the width, and 0.5x in the height, then you
//   want to do the vertical scale first, because it's around 3x faster
//   in that order.
//
//   In more normal circumstances, this makes a 20-40% differences, so
//     it's good to get right, but not critical. The normal way that you
//     decide which direction goes first is just figuring out which
//     direction does more multiplies. But with modern CPUs with their
//     fancy caches and SIMD and high IPC abilities, so there's just a lot
//     more that goes into it.
//
//   My handwavy sort of solution is to have an app that does a whole
//     bunch of timing for both vertical and horizontal first modes,
//     and then another app that can read lots of these timing files
//     and try to search for the best weights to use. Dotimings.c
//     is the app that does a bunch of timings, and vf_train.c is the
//     app that solves for the best weights (and shows how well it
//     does currently).
