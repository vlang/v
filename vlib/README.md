title: V standard library documentation
index: V stdlib
---
This site contains the documentation for the standard library of modules
included with the [V language](https://vlang.io).  Also commonly referred
to as `vlib`, as that is the root directory for these modules in the V
repository.

If you were looking for documentation for the language itself, the
builtin types, operators, et. al., please use the
[V documentation](https://docs.vlang.io/introduction.html) link.

Some included modules depend on third party libraries, and these are kept
separate in the `thirdparty` directory at the root level of the source
repository.

Note that the [builtin](https://modules.vlang.io/builtin.html) module is
implicitly imported by default in V, so you do not need to have a specific
`import` statement to use any of the features of that module.
