Equivalent to running `v build` and running the compiled executable.

Usage:
  v [build flags] run <file.v|directory|-> [arguments...]

This command is equivalent to running `v build` and running the compiled
executable.
The executable is passed the arguments as provided in [arguments...].

If the target is '-', it means that the V source code to build comes from stdin.
If the '-o' option is not specified, and the target is '-', a temporary base
name for the executable will be used.

The exit status of run will be:
* `1` if the compilation failed.
* The exit code of the compiled executable otherwise.

Flags specific to `v run`:
  -use-os-system-to-run
     Use os.system() to run the produced executable, instead of os.new_process;
     this is useful as a temporary workaround for segfaults, when running code
     on macos, that may happen when xcode is updated after 2023/08/30, and for
     comparing os.system with os.new_process on other systems. Usually used with:
     `export VFLAGS='-use-os-system-to-run'`.

For more about build flags, see `v help build`.
