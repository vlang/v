  Generates the documentation of a given MODULE, DIRECTORY, or FILE
  and prints or saves them to its desired format: HTML, JSON,
  TEXT, ANSI or Markdown.

Options:
  -all            Includes private and public functions/methods/structs/consts/enums.
  -color          Forces the use of ANSI escape sequences to make the output colorful.
  -no-color       Forces plain text output, without ANSI colors.
                  Note: -color is on for -f ansi .
  -f              Specifies the output format to be used.
                  Available formats are: md/markdown, json, text, ansi and html/htm.
  -h, -help       Prints this help text.
  -m              Generate docs for modules listed in that folder.
  -o              The output file/folder path where to store the docs. Use `-o stdout`
                  or `-o -', to print the output instead of saving it to a file.
  -readme         Include README.md to docs if present.
  -v              Enables verbose logging. For debugging purposes.
  -no-timestamp   Omits the timestamp in the output file.

For HTML mode:
  -inline-assets  Embeds the contents of the CSS and JS assets into the
                  webpage directly.
  -theme-dir      The directory for doc theme template

The following options are useful for tests, that need stable output.
They will omit generating text that is prone to changes, due to styling,
but that otherwise do not affect the content.
  -html-only-contents Produce just the main content of the page,
                      without theming, styling, CSS and JS tags etc.
  -html-no-vhash      Omits the version hash.
  -html-no-assets     Omits the CSS and JS asset tags.
  -html-no-right      Omits the doc-toc right panel.
  -html-no-toc-urls   Omits the toc_links panel
  -html-no-footer     Omits the footer panel.

For the text and ansi modes:
  -l              Shows the locations of the generated signatures.
  -comments       Includes comments in the output.

Note: set the environment variable `VDOC_SORT` to `false`, to avoid sorting the output.
