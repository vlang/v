Usage: v -native [-options] ['run'] <target.v|target_directory> [run options]

This command compiles the given target, along with their dependencies, into an executable using the Native code generation backend.

For more general build help, see also `v help build`.

# Interfacing the Native code generation, passing options to it:
   -v
      Display the assembly code generated (that may change to `-showasm` in the future)

   -arch <arch>
      Select target architecture, right now only `arm64` and `amd64` are supported

   -os <os>, -target-os <os>
      Change the target OS that V compiles for.

      The supported targets for the native backend are: `macos`, `linux` and 'windows'
