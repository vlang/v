# v-atomics

Low-level atomic operations for V with explicit i386 support (MMX required on i386).

Native atomic primitives for V implemented with inline assembly, without relying on C FFI.

This repository is an experiment in providing low-level atomic operations directly in V,
using V's inline assembly support.

At the moment, all operations provide sequentially consistent semantics.

## Motivation

In the current V ecosystem, atomic operations are implemented via calls into C.

While this approach works, it introduces an additional dependency on the C toolchain
and headers and limits control over the exact machine instructions being emitted.

x.atomics explores an alternative: **native atomic operations implemented directly in V**,
using architecture-specific inline assembly and explicit semantics.

The current focus of this project is:

- correctness of basic atomic primitives;
- predictable and inspectable code generation;
- sequentially consistent behavior for all operations.

In future versions, the set of supported atomic operations will be expanded,
and additional memory orderings will be introduced.

---

## Scope and Guarantees

- atomic operations on integer types implemented in V with inline assembly;
- architecture-specific implementations (per-platform `atomics.<arch>.v` files);
- **sequential consistency** for all exposed operations.

---

## Memory Model

All operations in this library are intended to be **sequentially consistent**:

- operations appear to be globally ordered;
- no weaker semantics (relaxed, acquire, release) are currently implemented;
- when weaker variants are added in the future, they will be explicitly named and documented.

---

## Examples

See the [examples](examples/) directory for complete runnable examples.

### Basic Usage

```v
import atomics

fn main() {
	mut value := i32(0)

	// Atomically store a value
	atomics.store_i32(&value, 42)

	// Atomically load the value
	loaded := atomics.load_i32(&value)

	// Atomic add: returns the new value after addition
	new_value := atomics.add_i32(&value, 10)

	// Atomic swap: returns the old value
	old := atomics.swap_i32(&value, 100)
}
```

### Compare-and-Swap (CAS)

```v
import atomics

fn main() {
	mut flag := u32(0)

	// CAS: if flag == 0, set it to 1; returns true on success
	if atomics.cas_u32(&flag, 0, 1) {
		println('Successfully changed flag from 0 to 1')
	}
}
```

### Available Operations
