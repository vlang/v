## Description

`math` provides commonly used mathematical functions for
trigonometry, logarithms, etc.

For floating point values, `math.abs` maps both signs of zero to positive zero.
`math.expm1` preserves its input's zero sign, so `math.expm1(-0.0)` returns negative zero.

`modf` preserves the input sign on both its integer and fractional results, including zero.
`log_gamma` returns the logarithm of the absolute value of Gamma; either positive or negative
infinity as input returns positive infinity.
