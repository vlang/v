module math

// q_sqrt computes an approximation of the inverse square root (1 / âˆšx) using a fast
// inverse square root algorithm. This method is often used in applications
// where performance is crucial, such as in computer graphics or physics
// simulations.
// (This algorithm is inspired by the famous "fast inverse square root" code
// used in the Quake III Arena game engine.)
