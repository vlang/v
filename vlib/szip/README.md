## Description

`szip` is a thin wrapper around [miniz.h](https://github.com/richgel999/miniz),
which in turn is "Single C source file zlib-replacement library,
originally from code.google.com/p/miniz".
It provides utility functions for reading/writing .zip files.

*TODO*
Merge/move under vlib/compress/zip .
