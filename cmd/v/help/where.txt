Usage:
  v where symbol_type symbol_name [params]

Examples:
  v where fn main
  v where struct User
  v where method Square.area
  v where fn pow -mod math
  v where interface callable -dir some -dir other

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Prints the location of the searched symbols in the scope of the current project.

symbol_name can be:
  fn                    by default if omit symbol_type (don't omit preferably)
  method                require Struct.method notation
  struct
  interface
  enum
  const
  var
  regexp

params:
  -mod  [mod_name]      Restrict to search recursively only within of the given 
                        module, if not provided search in entire v scope
                        (use -mod main to search inside all your project).
  -dir  [dir_path]      Restrict to search non recursively within the given 
                        folder/s, if not provided, search in entire v scope.
  -vis  [visibility]    Can be: all, pub, pri (all by default if not provided).
                        Restrict to search symbols with the given visibility.
  -mut  [mutability]    Can be: any, yes, not (any by default if not provided).
                        Restrict to search symbols with the given mutability.
flags:
  -h                    include Header
  -f                    Format output (each match uses 3 lines)
  -v                    for both above (more Verbose)

Note: 
  This tool is inspired by the vdoc tool and its design. However, this is 
  for a more specific use, and can be improved.
