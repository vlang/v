V is a tool for managing V source code.

Usage:
   v [options] [command] [arguments]

Examples:
   v hello.v                 Compile the file `hello.v` and output it as `hello` or `hello.exe`.
   v run hello.v             Same as above but also run the produced executable immediately after compilation.
   v -cg run hello.v         Same as above, but make debugging easier (in case your program crashes).
   v crun hello.v            Same as above, but do not recompile, if the executable already exists, and is newer than the sources.
   v -o h.c hello.v          Translate `hello.v` to `h.c`. Do not compile further.
   v -o - hello.v            Translate `hello.v` and output the C source code to stdout. Do not compile further.

   v watch hello.v           Re-does the same compilation, when a source code change is detected.
                             The program is only compiled, not run.
   v watch run hello.v       Re-runs the same `hello.v` file, when a source code change is detected.

V supports the following commands:
* New project scaffolding:
   new               Setup the file structure for a V project (in a sub folder).
   init              Setup the file structure for an already existing V project.

* Ordinary development:
   run               Compile and run a V program. Delete the executable after the run.
   crun              Compile and run a V program without deleting the executable.
                     If you run the same program a second time, without changing the source files,
                     V will just run the executable, without recompilation. Suitable for scripting.
   test              Run all test files in the provided directory.
   fmt               Format the V code provided.
   vet               Report suspicious code constructs.
   doc               Generate the documentation for a V module.
   vlib-docs         Generate and open the documentation of all the vlib modules.
   repl              Run the REPL.
   watch             Re-compile/re-run a source file, each time it is changed.
   where             Find and print the location of current project declarations. 

* Installation/self updating:
   symlink           Create a symbolic link for V.
   up                Run the V self-updater.
   self [-prod]      Run the V self-compiler, use -prod to optimize compilation.
   version           Print the version text and exits.

* Module/package management:
   install           Install a module from VPM.
   remove            Remove a module that was installed from VPM.
   search            Search for a module from VPM.
   update            Update an installed module from VPM.
   upgrade           Upgrade all the outdated modules.
   list              List all installed modules.
   outdated          List installed modules that need updates.
   show              Display information about a module on vpm

* Others:
   doctor            Display some useful info about your system to help reporting bugs.
   translate         Translate C code to V.
   tracev            Produce a tracing version of the v compiler.
                     Use `tracev yourfile.v` when the compiler panics.
                     NB: `tracev` is much slower and more verbose than ordinary `v`

Use "v help <command>" for more information about a command, example: `v help build`, `v help build-c`, `v help build-native`
Use "v help other" to see less frequently used commands.
Use "v help topics" to see a list of all known help topics.

Note: Help is required to write more help topics.
Only build, new, init, doc, fmt, vet, run, test, watch, search, install, remove, update, bin2v, check-md are properly documented currently.
