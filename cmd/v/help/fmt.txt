Usage:
  v fmt [options] path_to_source.v [path_to_other_source.v]
  v fmt [options] path/to/dir [path/to/other_dir]
  cat source.v | v fmt
        Read source code from stdin, output formatted file to stdout.

Formats the given V source files or recursively formats all files in the directory,
then prints their formatted source to stdout.

Options:
  -c      Check if a file is already formatted. If not, print the filepath and exit with code 2.
          Compared to -verify it is quicker but has a small trade-off in precision.

  -diff   Display the differences between the formatted source(s) and the original source(s).
          This will attempt to find a working `diff` command automatically unless you
          specify one with the VDIFF_TOOL environment variable.

  -l      List files whose formatting differs from vfmt.

  -w      Write result to (source) file(s) instead of to stdout.

  -debug  Print the kinds of encountered AST statements/expressions on stderr.

  -verify Make sure the provided file is already formatted. Useful for checking code contributions
          in CI for example.

Environment Variables:
  VDIFF_TOOL      A command-line tool that will be executed with the original file path
                  and a temporary formatted file path as arguments. e.g.
                  `VDIFF_TOOL=opendiff v fmt -diff path/to/file.v` will become:
                  opendiff path/to/file.v /tmp/v/vfmt_file.v

  VDIFF_OPTIONS   A set of command-line options to be sent immediately after the
                  `diff` command. e.g.
                  VDIFF_OPTIONS="-W 80 -y" v fmt -diff path/to/file.v /tmp/v/vfmt_file.v
