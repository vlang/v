Usage: v [C build flags] ['run'] <target.v|target_directory> [run options]

This command compiles the given target, along with their dependencies, into an executable.

This help topic explores the C-backend specific build flags. For more general build help,
see also `v help build`.

# Interfacing the C compiler, passing options to it:
   -cc <compiler>
      Change the C compiler V invokes to the specified compiler.
      The C compiler is required to support C99.
      Officially supported/tested C compilers include:
      `clang`, `gcc`, `tcc`, `mingw-w64` and `msvc`.

   -cflags <flag>
      Pass the provided flag as is to the C compiler.
      Can be specified multiple times to provide multiple flags.
      Use quotes to wrap the flag argument if it contains spaces.

   -showcc
      Prints the C command that is used to build the program.

   -freestanding
      Build the executable without dependency on libc.
      Supported only on `linux` targets currently.

   -os <os>, -target-os <os>
      Change the target OS that V tries to compile for.
      By default, the target OS is the host system.
      When OS is `cross`, V will attempt to output cross-platform C code.
      List of OS supported by V: `linux`, `windows`, `ios`, `mac`, `freebsd`, `openbsd`,
                                 `netbsd`, `dragonfly`, `solaris`, `android` and `haiku`.

      Note that V has the concept of platform files, i.e. files ending
      with `_platform.c.v`, and usually only the matching files are used in
      a compilation, and also it supports a `_default.c.v` file, that will
      be used, when no other more specific `_platform.c.v` file is found.
      The default is mainly useful for writing shims for new platforms,
      until a more specialized _platform.c.v is written instead.

      For example, suppose you have these 3 files:
          x_default.c.v
          x_windows.c.v
          x_linux.c.v
      If you compile with `-os freebsd`, then x_default.c.v will be used.
      If you compile with `-os linux`, then x_linux.c.v will be used.
      If you compile with `-os windows`, then x_windows.c.v will be used.
      If you compile with `-os cross`, then all, *except x_default.c.v*
      will be used, wrapped in conditional compilation guards, so that
      the generated C source code will be larger, but will compile on all
      explicitly supported platforms without source changes.

   -m32, -m64
      Specify whether 32-bit or 64-bit machine code is generated.

   -sanitize
      Pass flags related to sanitization to the C compiler.

   -shared
      Tell V to compile a shared object instead of an executable.
      The resulting file extension will be `.dll` on Windows and `.so` on Unix systems

# Memory management
   -autofree
      Free memory used in functions automatically.

   -manualfree
      Do not free memory used in functions (the developer has to put x.free()
      and unsafe{free(x)} calls manually in this mode).
      Some short lived applications, like compilers and other CLI tools are
      more performant without autofree.

# Miscellaneous:
   -printfn <fn_name>
      Print the content of the generated C function named fn_name.
      You can repeat that many times with different function names.
      This is useful when you just want to quickly tweak the generated
      C code, without opening the generated .c file in a text editor,
      i.e. it enables this workflow:

      1) change vlib/v/gen/cgen.v
      2) ./v -o v2 cmd/v && ./v2 -printfn main__main bug.v
      3) inspect the produced C, and goto 1) till the bug is fixed.

      Since V compiles itself very fast (especially with tcc),
      this loop is very short usually.

   -compress
      Strip the compiled executable to compress it.

   -live
      Build the executable with live capabilities (`[live]`).

   -no-prelude
      Prevents V from generating a prelude in generated .c files, useful for freestanding targets
      where eg. you replace C standard library with your own, or some definitions/headers break something.

   -custom-prelude <path>
      Useful for similar use-case as above option, except it replaces V-generated prelude with
      your custom one loaded from specified <path>.

# Debugging:
   -g
      Generate more debug information in the compiled executable.
      This makes program backtraces more useful.
      Using debuggers like gdb/lldb with such executables is easier too.
      Unlike `-cg` (described below), `-g` will enforce V source line numbers
      so that your debugger and the stacktraces will show you directly
      what .v file is responsible for each call/panic.

   -cg
      Like -g, but do not use V source line numbers.
      When debugging code that wraps C libraries, this option may be
      more useful than -g, since it will reduce the amount of context
      switching, that you need to do, while looking at .v and .c sources.
      This option is usually used in combination with `-keepc`.

   -keepc
      Do not remove the temporary .tmp.c and .tmp.c.rsp files.
      Also do not use a random prefix for them, so they would be fixed and predictable.

      NB: when writing low level code that interfaces/wraps an existing C library,
      it is frequently helpful to use these together: -keepc -cg -showcc -show-c-output

   -showcc
      Prints the C command that is used to build the program.

   -show-c-output
      Prints the output, that your C compiler produced, while compiling your program.

   -dump-c-flags file.txt
      Write all C flags into `file.txt`, one flag per line.
      If `file.txt` is `-`, then write the flags to stdout, one flag per line.
